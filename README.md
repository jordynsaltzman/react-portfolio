## Description

      For my updated portfolio, I wanted to create a minimalist design with a retro feel. I initially did all of the styling using my own CSS in order to acheive the specific layout I desired. However, I faced some issues with mobile responsiveness and eventually incorporated Bootstrap as a framework and media queries as well. I really enjoyed creating reusable components in React, and found it much more efficient than templating engines such as Handlebars used in previous projects. I also enjoyed using state and turnary operators for conditional rendering.
